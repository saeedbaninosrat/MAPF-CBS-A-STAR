there are N robots in a line every one has a [health, direction] property. health is a positive integer
and direction can either be 0 for left or 1 for right. all robots start at same time and have same speed.
if two robot colide with each other health of both of them get reduced by other ones health and
if a robot's health drops below zero that robot gets eliminated. robots never change direction.
now the task is to calculate who will survive at last.
